Medical Data

Problem 1
The attached ﬁle MedicalData1.mat has the medical data for a number of patients in the form of a 2D matrix DATA. The data for each patient are stored in a separate row. DATA has the following 7 columns :
1. a three-digit patient number
2. the systolic blood pressure in mm-Hg
3. the diastolic blood pressure in mm-Hg
4. the blood glucose in mg/dL
5. the total blood cholesterol in mg/dL
6. the LDL in mg/dL
7. the HDL in mg/dL

You need to copy MedicalData1.mat to a directory (such as the currently directory where the script program is located) where Matlab can ﬁnd it. Using the function/command load in a program retrieves the data stored in the variable DATA.
In this problem we assume that the maximum normal systolic and diastolic pressure are 140 mm-Hg and 90 mm-Hg, respectively. A person is considered to have high blood pressure if the systolic or the diastolic pressures are above their maximum normal values.
A patient is diabetic if the blood glucose exceeds 126 mg/dL.
There are maximum normal amounts for the total blood cholesterol, the LDL, and the HDL. Their respective values are given by 240, 130, and 45 mg/dL. A patient is considered to have cholesterol problem if the total cholesterol exceeds the maximum normal amount and if the ratio of the total cholesterol to HDL exceeds 5.
In this problem, we want to ﬁnd a subgroup of patients to undergo a clinical trial for a particular drug. A patient is selected if he or she has two or more of the problems with their blood pressure, blood glucose level, or cholesterol, as deﬁned above. Produce a list of patients (with their patient numbers) who should be selected.

For only the selected patients, ﬁnd the one whose LDL level is the highest. How high is that value? What is the patient number of that patient?
Next produce a data table for all the patients (whether selected or not) who has cholesterol problem as deﬁned above. The table should have their patient number in column 1, followed in columns 2 to 4 respectively by their LDL, HDL and total cholesterol levels.
In this problem use the output format: format short g throughout.
For the ﬁrst set of data (MedicalData1.mat), the output should be:
These patients meet the target: 
655 
873 
824 
619 
897 
125 
540 
251 
550 
153 
713 
138 
164

============================================================================== 
Of all the targeted patients, patient 619 has the highest LDL of 147.56 mg/dL. 
==============================================================================

Cholesterol levels of all patients having cholesterol problem:
# LDL (mg/dL) HDL (mg/dL) Tot Chol (mg/dL) 
==================================================== 
655	103.68	22.753	306.55 
824	89.28 	38.295 	275.31 
619 	147.56	46.645 	253.89 
251 	103.77 	46.904 	248.65 
550 	91.825 	47.332 	255.13 
713 	122.15 	36.888 	255.75 
164 	123.98 	28.551 	286.62
