Vectors

Problem 1
Given a column vector x of length n, compute the following sum
s = the summation from i=1 to n-1 of [100*(x_i^2 - x_(i+1))^2 + (i*x_i-1)^2]
for a vector generated by the statements:
n = 8;
a = -500;
b = 500;
Xvec = a + (b-a)*rand(n,1);


Problem 2
In this problem we reload the same matrix (matrix reloaded) of CPI data matrix. Here the user inputs any year between 1913 and 2013 from the keyboard and the program generates a 2D array of CPI data for n consecutive years in reverse chronological order (going backward in time). Each row of the data should indicate the year in column 1, followed by the CPI at the end of each of the quarters, i.e. the month of March, June, September and December, and ﬁnally the average CPI for that year.
The value of n must also be entered at runtime by the user (not the programmer).
For example if the starting year is 1979 and you want to view the quarterly CPI data for 3 consecutive years in reverse chronological order, then the result is
DATA = 1981.00 88.50 90.60 93.20 94.00 90.9 1980.00 80.10 82.70 84.00 86.30 82.4 1979.00 69.80 72.30 74.60 76.70 72.6
It turns out that the rates of inﬂation were very high during those 3 years.


Problem 3
In this problem we want to write a computer program to calculate the accumulated grade- point-average (GPA) of a student. The point system used for computing the GPA is:
1: A+ 4
2: A- 3.7
3: B+ 3.3
4: B 3
5: B- 2.7
6: C+ 2.3
7: C 2
8: F 0
Here for simplicity, we will use 1 to represent an A, 2 for an A-, 3 for a B+, etc. Thus we input the course grades as a vector with a value ranging from 1 to 8 for each of the courses taken.
Suppose a student had a B+ in a 3 credit course. The total points for that course is 3×3.3 = 9.9. The accumulated GPA is obtained by adding the points for each of the courses taken and dividing the result by the total number of credits.
For example, the vector [ 4 6 1 7 1 ] means that the student has a B, a C+, an A, a C, and another A.
The total number of courses taken is given by the length of this vector of ”grades”. The goal of this program is to compute the accumulated GPA based on this input. Another vector giving the number of credits for each of the courses must also be given. The ordering of the elements must be exactly the same as the courses for the vector of ”grades”. Here the vector is also entered by the user at runtime.
Thus if we enter a vector such as [ 3 4 3 3 1 ], it means that the credits for the above 5 courses are 3, 4, 3, 3, 1 respectively. Thus the student had a B in the ﬁrst course which has 3 credits, a C+ in the second course which has 4 credits, etc.
The above example should give an accumulated GPA of 2.8714.
